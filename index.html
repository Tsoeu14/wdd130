        <p>My name is Hlalefang and it means "to be smart", and I'd like to say I take after my name. I am a young woman
            who resides in Johannesburg, South Africa. I like to play board games and spend time with my family and friends. My favorite foods include pap and mogodu, pap and sebete and pap and wors. I also enjoy other foods and snacks but those 3 are my favorites. I live in a 4 person household and all my extended family is 3 hours away. I finished high school in 2021 and I've been working some part-time jobs to get by. I also like to listen to music and my favorite artist is  Shawn Mendes, Mimi Webb, Zoe Wees and Tate McRae. I enjoy other  activities like scatting and arts and crafts. blur blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu blu</p>
